# PNG Chunk Inspector

A local clone of pngchunk.com that actually works without sending your data to their servers, ads, or annoying cookie popups.

**Use it here:** [https://axoca.github.io/PNG-Chunk-Inspector/](https://axoca.github.io/PNG-Chunk-Inspector/)

Load PNG files or URLs to extract Stable Diffusion generation parameters directly in your browser. No server communication, no tracking, no BS - just pure functionality.

Your images and data stay on your machine. Unlike certain websites that need to phone home with your private stuff, this one just works.
